The goal of this assignment is to assess your ability to write a Python script that processes log files to extract and analyze key information. 
The code executes following operations:
-  extract all IP addresses.
- Calculate the number of requests made by each IP address.
- Sort and display the results in descending order of request counts.
-  Extract the endpoints (e.g., URLs or resource paths) from the log file.
- Identify the endpoint accessed the highest number of times.
- Provide the endpoint name and its access count.
- Searching for log entries with failed login attempts
- Flagging IP addresses with failed login attempts exceeding a configurable threshold.
- Display the flagged IP addresses and their failed login counts.
